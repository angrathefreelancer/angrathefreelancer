## About

<p>
Hi, I’m Ankit, a freelance mobile applications development located in Bangalore, India. I had spent 3+ years in the corporate world as a iOS developer, working both in the office and then working remotely from home. 
</p>

<p>
  I am a full time application developer, this is not a “hobby” for me. If you hire me, you can depend on me being available ongoing, as needed for years to come
